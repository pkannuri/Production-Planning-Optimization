# Production-Planning-Optimization
Operating under operational constraints and focusing on maximizing profitability

## Project Description
This project involves detailed production planning for the Salmones Puyuhuapi and Samona Pacific cases. The objective is to optimize the production of salmon products under operational constraints, focusing on maximizing profitability while adhering to freezer, filleting, and market limitations.

## Cases Overview
- **Salmones Puyuhuapi:** Focuses on the production planning of salmon in a constrained environment, aiming to maximize profit while ensuring efficient use of resources like freezers and filleting machines.
- **Samona Pacific:** Addresses the operational readiness for processing salmon immediately upon arrival from harvest, ensuring the best production mix based on current market conditions and available resources.

## Business Problems
1. **Optimizing Production Plans:** Developing strategies to efficiently allocate salmon to different product types (enteros, filetes, porciones) based on size and operational capabilities.
2. **Freezer and Filleting Constraints:** Addressing the limitations posed by freezer and filleting capacities and exploring opportunities to enhance these capabilities.
3. **Market and Pricing Strategy:** Aligning production with market demands and pricing strategies to optimize revenue and profit.

## Data Summary
- Utilizes comprehensive datasets detailing salmon weights, processing capacities, and market conditions.
- Focuses on real-time production adjustments based on incoming harvest characteristics.

## Models and Techniques Used
- **Linear Programming and Optimization Models:** To allocate resources effectively and maximize profits under constraints.
- **Predictive Analytics:** To forecast the impact of different production scenarios on profitability and operational efficiency.

## Key Insights
- **Profit Maximization:** Identifies the most lucrative production options based on the size distribution of incoming salmon and existing market prices.
- **Resource Optimization:** Provides strategies to manage limited freezer space and filleting capacity to enhance overall production efficiency.
- **Simplified Production Plans:** Suggests streamlined processes to comply with management's desire for simplicity and operational feasibility.
